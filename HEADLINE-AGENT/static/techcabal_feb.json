As one of Chowdeck’s top users in 2024, with 168 orders, she considers her app use excessive. Yet, like many New Year’s resolutions, this one quickly fell by the wayside.\n\nTwo weeks into January, she was already 20 orders deep—exactly where she left off in 2024. In the face of mounting deadlines and a busy life, January was already a lost cause, and February was the next “try again” date.\n\nFor users like Anita, food delivery apps like Chowdeck, [Glovo](https://techcabal.com/2023/05/10/how-glovo-is-redefining-the-future-of-grocery-shopping-in-nigeria/), FoodCourt, and Heyfood are more than meal solutions—they are essential tools for navigating the chaos of modern life. While these apps provide convenience, the tension between convenience and price gnaws at their users. According to data from Picodi, [Nigerian households spend 59% of their income on food](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/617577-nigerians-spend-over-half-of-their-earnings-on-food-worst-globally-report.html?tztc=1)—the highest of any country surveyed. For users like Anita, food delivery apps are a luxury that comes with an ongoing internal debate: Are they worth it? For many, the answer is yes.\n\n“I’m not happy with how much I spend on food, but there’s nothing I can do,” Anita admits. She juggles a social media marketing role and university classes, and for someone constantly on the go, the time saved by food delivery apps is invaluable.\n\nIt’s a humorous product-market fit: customers who can’t live without the apps making doomed-to-fail resolutions about quitting.  But not every user frowns at the cost.\n\nTake Ada, for example. In 2024, she placed 283 orders on Chowdeck but has no qualms about the growing expense. “Time is money, and Chowdeck saves me a lot of time,” she says.\n\nBefore her recent graduation, Ada balanced a demanding job as a product designer at a venture-backed beauty-tech startup with university classes and content creation on LinkedIn. Her days were packed with meetings, deliverables, and tight deadlines. In her world, time is at a premium, and Chowdeck provides a precious few extra hours every day.\n\nAda’s experience is one of predictability. She orders from the same restaurant almost daily, knowing exactly what to expect. It’s an experience she values deeply—reliable, efficient, and hassle-free. “I don’t care about variety,” she says. “I just want to know my food will be there when I need it.”\n\nYet, nothing is perfect. As with everything that gets a lot of use, they are users who are hyperaware of the limitations of food delivery apps.\n\nFayokunmi, another power user who placed nearly 300 orders in 2024, is considering switching to Glovo after a frustrating experience.\n\nHis regular order—a hearty meal of Amala with Ewedu and Gbegiri—had always been a satisfying ritual until a recent issue: the restaurant started separating his Gbegiri and Ewedu into two plates and charging him extra for the split.\n\nDespite leaving multiple notes asking them to plate his food together, the problem persisted. But his main gripe wasn’t the additional cost—it was that when he contacted customer support, the app deferred to the restaurant, saying nothing could be done.\n\nFor Fayokunmi, the issue wasn’t just about food or cost—it was about being let down by an app he had relied on for years. The lack of resolution from Chowdeck’s support team left him feeling alienated, he claimed, but he’s not ready to give up on food delivery apps altogether.\n\nHis reluctance to ditch the app speaks to a larger truth about food delivery apps in Nigeria: they’ve evolved from luxury services to vital productivity tools. For users like him, Ada, and Anita, these apps aren’t just about food—they’re about saving time in a world where every minute counts.\n\nThis shift in how people view food delivery apps is part of a broader trend. In a world where work and life demands are ever-growing, apps like Chowdeck and Glovo have embedded themselves into daily routines, making them more essential than ever. But this growing dependence comes with challenges. As food delivery services become more critical to people’s lives, they also face higher expectations and increased scrutiny.\n\nProviding convenience and consistent quality will be key to staying relevant in a contested market. Apps that can adapt quickly to user frustrations while keeping their core value proposition—time savings and convenience—intact will continue to thrive in the competitive food delivery landscape.\n\nThis highlights a key factor super users take seriously: variety. While users often develop loyalty to a single restaurant, a broad selection is crucial in attracting new customers and keeping them engaged.\n\nChowdeck, which claims to have a million users, seems to have mastered this. Six out of ten “super users” say the diverse restaurant selection drives their preference. This is likely driven by strategic partnerships, like a 2024 exclusive deal with Chicken Republic, which excluded other apps like Glovo and HeyFood from taking orders from the popular chain in specific prime locations.\n\nHowever, cost-conscious users trade variety for price. Take Adekunle Adeleke, a Glovo super user who briefly switched to Chowdeck for its more expansive selection of vendors. “Once \\[Chowdeck’s\\] delivery fees increased, I had to reconsider,” he told TechCabal.\n\nDelivery fees are a popular concern and can cost up to ₦1,000 on some apps, with service fees adding to the pile.\n\nTo remain competitive, platforms must find a balance—the right unit economics to ensure they’re not losing money on every delivery while giving customers the perception of a good deal.\n\nHistorically, food delivery companies have subsidised costs, charging users less than the service cost. The extent of these subsidies often depends on the company’s funding. Glovo, operating in 7 countries, has raised over $1 billion—over 200 times the amount raised by local competitors like Chowdeck, HeyFood, and FoodCourt combined.\n\nYet well-funded companies like Bolt Food and Jumia Food have exited the segment, citing a race to the bottom and unsustainable unit economics. The players that have taken their place are innovating around sustainability concerns.\n\nGlovo and Chowdeck have introduced subscription plans to users potential cost savings and encouraging them to place more orders.\n\nGlovo Prime, for instance, has a ₦2,000 monthly subscription that helps users save on delivery fees. Chowdeck offers a ₦3,500 monthly plan, ChowPass, that discounts fees from select restaurants. These cost savings are important with Adekunle Adeleke claiming to have saved over ₦116,000 in three months with Glovo Prime, ordering at least once daily from Glovo.\n\nDolapo, a director at a fintech startup, subscribes to ChowPass and Glovo Prime and spends around ₦400,000 monthly on food delivery. She prefers Chowdeck for its variety but relies on Glovo for groceries and competitive pricing. “The market is chaotic, and I need to optimise for productivity.”\n\nHowever, users want increased functionality and convenience. Aderinsola Oluwafemi, a product designer and Chowdeck super user who placed 220 orders in 2024 wants to order from multiple restaurants simultaneously. That way, she doesn’t need to leave her apartment multiple times to pick up orders. “I know this will be hard,” says Oluwafemi, who is also a product designer.\n\n“Time is money, and it is saving me a lot of time,” said Peace Solomon, a self-described Chowdeck loyalist, who spends around ₦50,000 on Chowdeck orders weekly. “I use my free time to study and create content for my LinkedIn.”\n\nAdeleke, a Glovo user, wants a wider restaurant selection and more reliable deliveries. “It can be a real fight to get your food on time,” he told TechCabal, citing instances of Glovo riders making deliveries barefoot. While Glovo provides full refunds for such incidents, he would prefer if it happened less frequently.\n\nDespite the feedback, food delivery apps are generally in lockstep with their users—this goldmine of a customer segment happy to spend money consistently so they can be productivity machines. That sort of trade-off is familiar to the ambitious, who understand that being productive is about making marginal changes. So what if they spend 30 to 40% of their income on food delivery apps? It’ll ensure they have entertaining New Year’s resolutions for 2026.\n\nShare this article\n\n[![](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/02/Ngozi-Chukwu.png)](https://techcabal.com/profile/ngozi-chukwu/)\n\n[**Ngozi Chukwu**](https://techcabal.com/profile/ngozi-chukwu/) Reporter\n\n[![](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/02/Olumuyiwa-Olowogboyega.png)](https://techcabal.com/profile/olumuyiwa-olowogboyega/)\n\n[**Olumuyiwa Olowogboyega**](https://techcabal.com/profile/olumuyiwa-olowogboyega/) Newsroom Editor\n\n## Get the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nCountry Afghanistan Albania Algeria American Samoa Andorra Angola Anguilla Antarctica Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bermuda Bhutan Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Bouvet Island Brazil British Antarctic Territory British Indian Ocean Territory British Virgin Islands Brunei Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Canada Canton and Enderbury Islands Cape Verde Cayman Islands Central African Republic Chad Chile China Christmas Island Cocos \\[Keeling\\] Islands Colombia Comoros Congo - Brazzaville Congo - Kinshasa Cook Islands Costa Rica Croatia Cuba Cyprus Czech Republic Côte d’Ivoire Denmark Djibouti Dominica Dominican Republic Dronning Maud Land East Germany Ecuador Egypt El Salvador Equatorial Guinea Eritrea Estonia Ethiopia Falkland Islands Faroe Islands Fiji Finland France French Guiana French Polynesia French Southern Territories French Southern and Antarctic Territories Gabon Gambia Georgia Germany Ghana Gibraltar Greece Greenland Grenada Guadeloupe Guam Guatemala Guernsey Guinea Guinea-Bissau Guyana Haiti Heard Island and McDonald Islands Honduras Hong Kong SAR China Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran Iraq Ireland Isle of Man Israel Italy Jamaica Japan Jersey Johnston Island Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kiribati Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Laos Latvia Lebanon Lesotho Liberia Libya Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Macau SAR China Macedonia Madagascar Malawi Malaysia Maldives Mali Malta Marshall Islands Martinique Mauritania Mauritius Mayotte Metropolitan France Mexico Micronesia Midway Islands Moldova Monaco Mongolia Montenegro Montserrat Morocco Mozambique Myanmar \\[Burma\\] Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands Netherlands Antilles Neutral Zone New Caledonia New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria Niue Norfolk Island North Korea North Vietnam Northern Mariana Islands Norway Oman Pacific Islands Trust Territory Pakistan Palau Palestinian Territories Panama Panama Canal Zone Papua New Guinea Paraguay People's Democratic Republic of Yemen Peru Philippines Pitcairn Islands Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Romania Russia Rwanda Réunion Saint Barthélemy Saint Helena Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Martin Saint Pierre and Miquelon Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Samoa San Marino Saudi Arabia Senegal Serbia Serbia and Montenegro Seychelles Sierra Leone Singapore Slovakia Slovenia Solomon Islands Somalia South Africa South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands South Korea Spain Sri Lanka Sudan Suriname Svalbard and Jan Mayen Swaziland Sweden Switzerland Syria São Tomé and Príncipe Taiwan Tajikistan Tanzania Thailand Timor-Leste Togo Tokelau Tonga Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia Turkey Turkmenistan Turks and Caicos Islands Tuvalu U.S. Minor Outlying Islands U.S. Miscellaneous Pacific Islands U.S. Virgin Islands Uganda Ukraine Union of Soviet Socialist Republics United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States Unknown or Invalid Region Uruguay Uzbekistan Vanuatu Vatican City Venezuela Vietnam Wake Island Wallis and Futuna Western Sahara Yemen Zambia Zimbabwe Åland Islands\n?>\n\nGender\nMale\nFemale\nOthers\n\nTC DailyEvents\n\nSubscribe\n\nFacebook\n\n2 comments\n\nSort by\n\n[Oldest](https://www.facebook.com/plugins/feedback.php?app_id=252296078952383&channel=https%3A%2F%2Fstaticxx.facebook.com%2Fx%2Fconnect%2Fxd_arbiter%2F%3Fversion%3D46%23cb%3Df3465bd43169ecee3%26domain%3Dtechcabal.com%26is_canvas%3Dfalse%26origin%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftechcabal.com%252Ff92e1567c9a797279%26relation%3Dparent.parent&color_scheme=dark&container_width=1920&height=100&href=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcabal.com%2F2025%2F02%2F04%2Fchowdeck-glovo-superusers%2F&locale=en_GB&mobile=true&numposts=10&sdk=joey&version=v3.1&width#)\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v1/yi/r/odA9sNLrE86.jpg)\n\n![](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.30497-1/453178253_471506465671661_2781666950760530985_n.png?stp=cp0_dst-png_s48x48&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=22ec41&_nc_ohc=7gIifu-CZRIQ7kNvgGww_wf&_nc_oc=Adia8SgpgMrd0ellqUxWm_-fnAV8hDdH4UBaobqPvnyVxZa-gpmg4-xeQSy2riPYenc&_nc_zt=24&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&edm=AJqh0Q8EAAAA&_nc_gid=AQxpwgxAFiIGNSNxdx3C8_e&oh=00_AYDqKO_-ogMI9jj9hEe8TOgJWGgBJNBuh8WeDd8XeAntdw&oe=67CB24BA)\n\nBalogun Elizabeth\n\nN.

Photo by Tomoko Wakabayashi.\n\nShare\n\nAmerican technology company [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/) has ended its operations in Nigeria, Ghana, and other key African markets, transferring its regional functions to MIBB, a subsidiary of Midis Group, a multinational IT and telecommunications conglomerate operating across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. This move comes as part of a new operating model that IBM will implement in select African countries, effective April 1, 2025.\n\nMIBB will market and sell IBM’s products and services across 36 African countries, giving MIBB’s sales network direct access to IBM’s software, hardware, cloud, and consulting offerings. This partnership is expected to boost innovation and growth in the region, with MIBB taking over the responsibility of IBM’s operations, support, and local customer relationships, the company stated in an email to TechCabal.\n\nHaving been in Nigeria for over 50 years, IBM was integral to the technology landscape, providing infrastructure and consulting services to critical industries such as banking, telecommunications, oil and gas, and government. In particular, the company’s high-end storage and computing solutions were widely used by major banks like Zenith. However, increasing competition from companies like Dell and [Huawei](https://techcabal.com/2024/09/10/huawei-storage-deal-with-uba/)—both of which have expanded their footprint in Nigeria’s banking sector—has led to a shrinking client base for IBM.\n\nBeyond the challenges in Africa, IBM has faced financial difficulties globally. In 2024, the company reported a 2% decline in consulting revenue to $5.18 billion, while infrastructure sales dropped by 8%. Despite these setbacks, IBM reported a 1% overall revenue increase, reaching $17.55 billion, driven by a 10% growth in software sales, which climbed to $7.92 billion. IBM also posted a net income of $2.92 billion in the fourth quarter and expects at least 5% revenue growth in 2025, bolstered by projected free cash flow of $13.5 billion.\n\nAlthough IBM’s departure from West Africa marks the end of its direct operations in the region, the long-term impact on local businesses and government partnerships remains uncertain. While the transition to MIBB may offer new opportunities for innovation and support, it also presents challenges for businesses that have relied on IBM’s products and services. The full effect of this shift will likely unfold over the coming months as the African tech ecosystem adjusts to the new operational model.\n\nShare this article\n\n## Get the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nCountry Afghanistan Albania Algeria American Samoa Andorra Angola Anguilla Antarctica Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bermuda Bhutan Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Bouvet Island Brazil British Antarctic Territory British Indian Ocean Territory British Virgin Islands Brunei Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Canada Canton and Enderbury Islands Cape Verde Cayman Islands Central African Republic Chad Chile China Christmas Island Cocos \\[Keeling\\] Islands Colombia Comoros Congo - Brazzaville Congo - Kinshasa Cook Islands Costa Rica Croatia Cuba Cyprus Czech Republic Côte d’Ivoire Denmark Djibouti Dominica Dominican Republic Dronning Maud Land East Germany Ecuador Egypt El Salvador Equatorial Guinea Eritrea Estonia Ethiopia Falkland Islands Faroe Islands Fiji Finland France French Guiana French Polynesia French Southern Territories French Southern and Antarctic Territories Gabon Gambia Georgia Germany Ghana Gibraltar Greece Greenland Grenada Guadeloupe Guam Guatemala Guernsey Guinea Guinea-Bissau Guyana Haiti Heard Island and McDonald Islands Honduras Hong Kong SAR China Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran Iraq Ireland Isle of Man Israel Italy Jamaica Japan Jersey Johnston Island Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kiribati Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Laos Latvia Lebanon Lesotho Liberia Libya Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Macau SAR China Macedonia Madagascar Malawi Malaysia Maldives Mali Malta Marshall Islands Martinique Mauritania Mauritius Mayotte Metropolitan France Mexico Micronesia Midway Islands Moldova Monaco Mongolia Montenegro Montserrat Morocco Mozambique Myanmar \\[Burma\\] Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands Netherlands Antilles Neutral Zone New Caledonia New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria Niue Norfolk Island North Korea North Vietnam Northern Mariana Islands Norway Oman Pacific Islands Trust Territory Pakistan Palau Palestinian Territories Panama Panama Canal Zone Papua New Guinea Paraguay People's Democratic Republic of Yemen Peru Philippines Pitcairn Islands Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Romania Russia Rwanda Réunion Saint Barthélemy Saint Helena Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Martin Saint Pierre and Miquelon Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Samoa San Marino Saudi Arabia Senegal Serbia Serbia and Montenegro Seychelles Sierra Leone Singapore Slovakia Slovenia Solomon Islands Somalia South Africa South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands South Korea Spain Sri Lanka Sudan Suriname Svalbard and Jan Mayen Swaziland Sweden Switzerland Syria São Tomé and Príncipe Taiwan Tajikistan Tanzania Thailand Timor-Leste Togo Tokelau Tonga Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia Turkey Turkmenistan Turks and Caicos Islands Tuvalu U.S. Minor Outlying Islands U.S. Miscellaneous Pacific Islands U.S. Virgin Islands Uganda Ukraine Union of Soviet Socialist Republics United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States Unknown or Invalid Region Uruguay Uzbekistan Vanuatu Vatican City Venezuela Vietnam Wake Island Wallis and Futuna Western Sahara Yemen Zambia Zimbabwe Åland Islands\n?>\n\nGender\nMale\nFemale\nOthers\n\nTC DailyEvents\n\nSubscribe\n\nFacebook\n\n1 comment\n\nSort by\n\n[Oldest](https://www.facebook.com/plugins/feedback.php?app_id=252296078952383&channel=https%3A%2F%2Fstaticxx.facebook.com%2Fx%2Fconnect%2Fxd_arbiter%2F%3Fversion%3D46%23cb%3Dfcf2b790a94bf553d%26domain%3Dtechcabal.com%26is_canvas%3Dfalse%26origin%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftechcabal.com%252Ff354f4f89a0024e7a%26relation%3Dparent.parent&color_scheme=dark&container_width=1920&height=100&href=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcabal.com%2F2025%2F02%2F05%2Fibm-exits-african-markets%2F&locale=en_GB&mobile=true&numposts=10&sdk=joey&version=v3.1&width#)\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v1/yi/r/odA9sNLrE86.jpg)\n\n[![](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/464616503_122106914696575047_5160743880997121441_n.jpg?stp=c55.0.176.176a_cp0_dst-jpg_s48x48_tt6&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=fe756c&_nc_ohc=qwFpojKroXUQ7kNvgGgKHEU&_nc_oc=AdikB0o1Xeal_-mNPliVLy1QWYqwxxTJ5uiPUAgyB65TTwAeBDtcb4dQC6xOu-dMuKU&_nc_zt=24&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&edm=AJqh0Q8EAAAA&_nc_gid=AbDTIBGeCGYRSauMyuLE8H1&oh=00_AYDumm9_QPByQbKKKj0n_ndseLLDdspfI0H_u9tnQdqhdA&oe=67A9766F)](https://www.facebook.com/people/E-Auction-in-progress/61567251433894/?ref=embed_comment)\n\n[E-Auction in progress](https://www.facebook.com/people/E-Auction-in-progress/61567251433894/?ref=embed_comment)\n\nN.

Image Source: TechCabal\n\nShare\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has officially launched the National Broadband Alliance for Nigeria (NBAN), a policy initiative to expand internet access nationwide. The initiative targets key sectors, including schools, healthcare facilities, religious centers, and markets, in a bid to create a sustainable model for widespread broadband adoption.\n\nNBAN aligns with Nigeria’s National Broadband Plan (2020-2025) and the Strategic Blueprint from the Ministry of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy. The initiative’s goals include increasing broadband penetration from 44% in December 2024 to 70% by 2025, providing minimum data speeds of 25 Mbps in urban areas and 10 Mbps in rural areas, and boosting broadband investments by 300–500% by 2027.\n\nNBAN adopts a collaborative approach, bringing together state governments, schools, hospitals, telecom operators, and infrastructure companies to drive broadband expansion across the country. The initiative starts with a pilot program in eight states: Edo, Ogun, Kwara, Katsina, Imo, Abia, Borno, and Nasarawa.\n\n“Achieving these goals will require more than just the efforts of the private sector. It will require a holistic approach that includes strategic partnerships with donors, investors, and other key stakeholders in accelerating the roll-out of critical infrastructure,” Aminu Maida, executive vice chairman of the NCC said at the kick-off meeting in Lagos on Tuesday.\n\nIn a related development, on January 20, 2025, the [NCC approved a 50% tariff increase](https://techcabal.com/2025/01/22/telco-tariff-hike-insufficient/) for telecom operators, with the condition that service quality must improve within three months of implementation. While the new tariffs are not yet in effect, operators are already preparing to comply with the NCC’s requirements.\n\nThe NCC has also [reportedly](https://technologytimes.ng/exclusive-ncc-okays-mtn-nigeria-9mobile-roaming/) approved a roaming and spectrum-sharing agreement between MTN Nigeria and 9mobile. Under the agreement, 9mobile, Nigeria’s fourth-largest telecom operator, will leverage MTN’s nationwide infrastructure to improve its network coverage. This arrangement enables 9mobile subscribers to make calls, send messages, and use data services in areas where 9mobile lacks coverage. For MTN, the partnership offers profit-sharing opportunities and access to 9mobile’s spectrum holdings, including the 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 2100 MHz bands.\n\nAirtel Nigeria has also outlined plans to expand its network to more locations, upgrade existing sites, and enhance service delivery, according to CEO Dinesh Balsingh. However, meeting the NCC’s three-month deadline could be a significant challenge. As of January 2025, Nigeria’s internet penetration stands at 44%, significantly lower than South Africa and Egypt, which reported 74.7% and 72.2% penetration in 2024, respectively. Additionally, Nigeria struggles with low-speed internet deployment, with 4G penetration at 47% and 5G at just 2.4%, two years after its launch.\n\n“Tariff increase is not all the problem that the industry faces,” Gbenga Adebayo, President of the Association of Licenced Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria said at a telecom CEOs town hall last week. According to him, the 50% increase only allows the operators to recoup some of the revenue losses and fund infrastructure deployment in some underserved areas. Still, it does not address multiple taxation, vandalism of telecom infrastructure, and insecurity across the country.\n\nAminu Maida, NCC’s executive vice chairman, believes the NBAN initiative can help address these challenges in three key ways: streamlining regulatory processes to expedite fibre deployment, creating incentives for private-sector investment in underserved areas, and launching public awareness campaigns to encourage broadband adoption and usage.\n\nShare this article\n\n[![Frank Eleanya](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2024/01/Frank-Eleanya.png)](https://techcabal.com/profile/frank-eleanya/)\n\n[**Frank Eleanya**](https://techcabal.com/profile/frank-eleanya/) Senior Reporter, Nigeria\n\n## Get the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nCountry Afghanistan Albania Algeria American Samoa Andorra Angola Anguilla Antarctica Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bermuda Bhutan Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Bouvet Island Brazil British Antarctic Territory British Indian Ocean Territory British Virgin Islands Brunei Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Canada Canton and Enderbury Islands Cape Verde Cayman Islands Central African Republic Chad Chile China Christmas Island Cocos \\[Keeling\\] Islands Colombia Comoros Congo -

Okubanjo resigned on January 30, despite [denying the allegations](https://techcabal.com/2025/01/27/bento-africa-investigation/#:~:text=Bento%20Africa%20under%20investigation%20by%20LIRS%20and%20EFCC%3B%20CEO%20Okubanjo%20denies%20allegations&text=Bento%20Africa%2C%20a%20Nigerian%20technology,payments%20on%20behalf%20of%20clients.) and in a statement purportedly sent by investors, the company claimed it was in the process of retrieving credentials from Okubanjo.\n\nHowever, at least two investors told TechCabal they did not see that letter.\n\nDespite Okubanjo’s apparent resignation, he continued communicating with Bento employees on January 31. It is unclear if he addressed the issues with employees who became worried when he informed them their salaries would be “strategically delayed” until they processed all pending payroll for customers.\n\n“It’s January, and everyone is going through it financially,” an affected ex-employee wrote in a Google Chat message reviewed by TechCabal. “Even amidst all the chaos, we’re still here working without knowing where the company is headed. The team has collectively agreed to halt all operations until we get paid,” the same employee wrote.\n\nOkubanjo emphasized Bento’s history of prompt salary payments, even for short-term employees. He claimed the delay was a strategic measure anticipating resignations due to the ongoing controversies. When employees refused to get on with work, Okubanjo treated the protest as resignations, deactivating the employees’ work emails without pay.\n\nHe claimed the employees were attempting to force his hand and offered to divide the withheld salaries among any employees willing to stay and process payroll. “If we end up with two employees making 3 million each, that is it,” he stated in the Google Chat messages.\n\nNo one took up his offer, three people with knowledge of the situation said.\n\n“I don’t work for Bento so I am unable to respond on its behalf,” Okubanjo said in a statement to TechCabal.\n\nBento’s now laid-off tech team consists primarily of young engineers in the early stages of their careers, most having been with the company for a little over a year. The last of the founding tech team resigned in 2024, one person claimed.\n\nFriday’s abrupt layoffs have stalled Bento’s operations, particularly with payroll processing for its customers. The company, which had previously automated salary disbursements, has had to manually process payments since 2024 due to issues with payment processors and underfunded accounts. “With all the engineers gone, there is almost no one to run payroll,” said one employee.\n\nHowever, in an email to customers, Bento claimed it intentionally halted transactions to facilitate a transfer of platform credentials from Okubanjo to an interim overseer.\n\nA Bento employee who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals said he only learned about the allegations about forged tax receipts on social media and was worried about the impact on his career.\n\n“I even took the company off my LinkedIn for a while,” said the employee, who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal. He claimed other employees shared his concerns but were also shocked when Okubanjo deactivated their work emails.\n\nShare this article\n\n## Get the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nCountry Afghanistan Albania Algeria American Samoa Andorra Angola Anguilla Antarctica Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bermuda Bhutan Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Bouvet Island Brazil British Antarctic Territory British Indian Ocean Territory British Virgin Islands Brunei Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Canada Canton and Enderbury Islands Cape Verde Cayman Islands Central African Republic Chad Chile China Christmas Island Cocos \\[Keeling\\] Islands Colombia Comoros Congo - Brazzaville Congo - Kinshasa Cook Islands Costa Rica Croatia Cuba Cyprus Czech Republic Côte d’Ivoire Denmark Djibouti Dominica Dominican Republic Dronning Maud Land East Germany Ecuador Egypt El Salvador Equatorial Guinea Eritrea Estonia Ethiopia Falkland Islands Faroe Islands Fiji Finland France French Guiana French Polynesia French Southern Territories French Southern and Antarctic Territories Gabon Gambia Georgia Germany Ghana Gibraltar Greece Greenland Grenada Guadeloupe Guam Guatemala Guernsey Guinea Guinea-Bissau Guyana Haiti Heard Island and McDonald Islands Honduras Hong Kong SAR China Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran Iraq Ireland Isle of Man Israel Italy Jamaica Japan Jersey Johnston Island Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kiribati Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Laos Latvia Lebanon Lesotho Liberia Libya Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Macau SAR China Macedonia Madagascar Malawi Malaysia Maldives Mali Malta Marshall Islands Martinique Mauritania Mauritius Mayotte Metropolitan France Mexico Micronesia Midway Islands Moldova Monaco Mongolia Montenegro Montserrat Morocco Mozambique Myanmar \\[Burma\\] Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands Netherlands Antilles Neutral Zone New Caledonia New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria Niue Norfolk Island North Korea North Vietnam Northern Mariana Islands Norway Oman Pacific Islands Trust Territory Pakistan Palau Palestinian Territories Panama Panama Canal Zone Papua New Guinea Paraguay People's Democratic Republic of Yemen Peru Philippines Pitcairn Islands Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Romania Russia Rwanda Réunion Saint Barthélemy Saint Helena Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Martin Saint Pierre and Miquelon Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Samoa San Marino Saudi Arabia Senegal Serbia Serbia and Montenegro Seychelles Sierra Leone Singapore Slovakia Slovenia Solomon Islands Somalia South Africa South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands South Korea Spain Sri Lanka Sudan Suriname Svalbard and Jan Mayen Swaziland Sweden Switzerland Syria São Tomé and Príncipe Taiwan Tajikistan Tanzania Thailand Timor-Leste Togo Tokelau Tonga Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia Turkey Turkmenistan Turks and Caicos Islands Tuvalu U.S. Minor Outlying Islands U.S. Miscellaneous Pacific Islands U.S. Virgin Islands Uganda Ukraine Union of Soviet Socialist Republics United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States Unknown or Invalid Region Uruguay Uzbekistan Vanuatu Vatican City Venezuela Vietnam Wake Island Wallis and Futuna Western Sahara Yemen Zambia Zimbabwe Åland Islands\n?>\n\nGender\nMale\nFemale\nOthers\n\nTC DailyEvents\n\nSubscribe\n\nFacebook\n\n2 comments\n\nSort by\n\n[Oldest](https://www.facebook.com/plugins/feedback.php?app_id=252296078952383&channel=https%3A%2F%2Fstaticxx.facebook.com%2Fx%2Fconnect%2Fxd_arbiter%2F%3Fversion%3D46%23cb%3Df4bfbc0773d4ecade%26domain%3Dtechcabal.com%26is_canvas%3Dfalse%26origin%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftechcabal.com%252Fff88ae027339c467d%26relation%3Dparent.parent&color_scheme=dark&container_width=1920&height=100&href=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcabal.com%2F2025%2F02%2F04%2Fbento-layoff-tech-team%2F&locale=en_GB&mobile=true&numposts=10&sdk=joey&version=v3.1&width#)\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v1/yi/r/odA9sNLrE86.jpg)\n\n[![](https://scontent-lax3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-1/462532312_1085514606245789_6973701040622778393_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_s48x48_tt6&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=fe756c&_nc_ohc=kHHDaHAtbsoQ7kNvgH_EZwu&_nc_oc=AdhCXqyE9xngILhqPJYFlMRiRkVoSjOyuZedDSM54HEfFqdeHwQedEXRrBUtcbMAoL4&_nc_zt=24&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.xx&edm=AJqh0Q8EAAAA&_nc_gid=AuPjKOYbnIAVY5g1ZEr0Mml&oh=00_AYBkChMamlzadwUDEWg7lppzfnjEdQBB9ox3RYKH9tQ9qQ&oe=67A978D4)](https://www.facebook.com/people/Patricia-W-Cherry/61567138346063/?ref=embed_comment)\n\n[Patricia W.

Yet, pervasive societal biases against marginalised groups, particularly gender and sexuality, continue to seep into even this seemingly progressive industry.\n\nWhile women-only training initiatives have gained traction, the unique challenges faced by queer people, who often encounter hostility in diverse learning environments, remain largely unaddressed.\n\nIn 2021, the Center for Health Education and Vulnerable Support ( [CHEVS](https://www.chevs.org/)),  a human rights organisation focused on queer people, launched Tech4Pride, a fellowship that exclusively trains queer people in in-demand tech skills such as data analysis, software development, and marketing. Tech4Pride is one of the few initiatives in the country teaching queer individuals coding and non-coding skills.\n\nThe cohort-based fellowship has trained over 100 people and placed 76% of them in jobs, according to Kenny Owen who heads the cohort-based fellowship. It is also working to include mentorship opportunities to connect tech talent to established queer founders or tech executives for career development.\n\nDuring their training, Tech4Pride fellowship members develop tech projects presented at graduation. These projects often address unique challenges faced by the queer community that are typically overlooked due to their specific nature. They include apps for HIV aftercare, menstrual cycle tracking, security alerts, police interaction aids, and identity verification to combat queerbaiting on social media platforms.\n\n“We want to replicate the same support that women-focused communities in tech provide for their members,” Anita Graham, a CHEVS co-director, told TechCabal.\n\nThe immediate goal of increasing tech skills among queer people is economic empowerment unrestricted by location.\n\n“Queer people seek financial freedom \\[especially\\] through transferable skills unrestricted by location,” Graham said.\n\nQueer people often migrate to countries with more favourable LGBTQIA+ laws to escape persecution and discrimination in countries like Nigeria where queerness is criminalised. With globally in-demand tech skills, queer people can increase their potential for migration.\n\nAnother goal is to increase inclusivity within the tech ecosystem. Having more queer people as tech operators and founders provides a unique perspective, allowing for the development of solutions that address the specific challenges faced by the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nWhile there is extensive research on the experiences of women in education and tech, little to no research exists on the experiences of queer people in these fields in Africa. Graham explains that the need for the queer-focused fellowship was identified through the lived experiences of queer Nigerians.\n\nConversations with queer communities, key informants, and focused groups show that there is a low completion rate of physical and virtual tech skills training among queer people, she said.\n\nOne highly placed manager at HNG—a popular tech skill acquisition programme—who declined to be named to speak freely,  told TechCabal that though he thinks “what you learn and who you are necessarily correlated,…there could be some discrimination in offline training.”\n\nChiamaka Adewu\\*, who recently founded a women-focused tech skill empowerment community, said marginalised groups often feel uncomfortable in diverse learning spaces, which can negatively impact their performance.\n\nSimilar dynamics exist among women and even religious groups who have created their communities for learning and support.\n\n“Communities are incredibly powerful, and it can’t be overstated how much safer people feel among those who share their experiences and beliefs,” she said.\n\nGraham noted that in diverse tech skills acquisition programmes that require physical attendance,  the unconventional fashion choices of queer people often lead to assumptions about their sexual orientation, shaping social interactions.  Individuals who express themselves in ways that challenge traditional gender norms—including dressing in masculine clothing— face heightened risks of physical violence.\n\nHomophobic remarks, slurs, or physical harassment can create a climate of fear and intimidation, making it difficult for queer people to focus on their studies.\n\nOne male queer person who identifies as a femme told TechCabal that they felt a pressure to be unnecessarily amusing or social to distract people from picking on their feminine traits.\n\nWhile virtual learning spaces can offer physical distance, diverse online training spaces are not immune to discrimination. Online activities required by virtual classes can expose students’ digital footprints, making them vulnerable to harassment.\n\nAs Graham explained, “Sometimes, fellow students find their digital footprint on social media where they are more expressive of their sexuality, and that has often led to outing, attacks, doxxing, and cyberstalking.”\n\nWhile initiatives like Tech4Pride play a crucial role in promoting inclusivity, their sustainability often hinges on the availability of external funding. This reliance on grants and donations can be risky.  Throughout 2024, Tech4Pride paused enrollment to focus on fundraising. The initiative did not run any cohort training this year—the third cohort has been deferred to 2025. A CHEV’s spokesperson said the company raised money this year but declined to indicate how much.\n\nA commercial model would be more sustainable.  Edtech startups and skills acquisition initiatives by for-profit businesses should consider the unique needs of queer trainees.\n\nHowever, one tech boot camp founder, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely,  explained that the tech ecosystem, while more open-minded than many other sectors, hardly prioritises the specific needs of LGBTQIA+ groups.\n\n“There is just too much of a spectrum in Nigeria – we have very conservative people to very liberal people. If the boot camp is too liberal-friendly, you lose the conservative people,” they said.\n\n**_\\*Names have been changed to protect the person’s identity._**\n\nShare this article\n\n## Get the best

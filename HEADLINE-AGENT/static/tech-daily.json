IMAGE \\| KBA\n\nSafaricom, Kenya‚Äôs largest telecom, and commercial banks are once again making their case known. After submitting a report to the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) stating that building a new fast payment system (FPS) could [cost the apex bank $200 million](https://techcabal.com/2025/01/15/safaricom-banks-payment-cbk/) and take four years, both parties are trying to convince the CBK that [upgrading the Pesalink should be the way to go](https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/safaricom-pesalink-banks-fps/).\n\nSafaricom and the KBA argue that improving Pesalink would be faster and cheaper than starting from scratch. However, a key concern is Pesalink‚Äôs transaction cap; the payment infrastructure, which currently allows only inter-bank transfers, [supports $8.5 billion (KES1.1 trillion) in transactions](https://www.ipsl.co.ke/pesalink), which raises questions about whether it can handle Kenya‚Äôs growing payment needs should other financial service providers come onboard. Compared to the payment infrastructure of some other African countries, this falls short.\n\nYet, this cap exists to manage liquidity, ensuring that banks have enough cash to settle transactions in real-time. Because their liquidity isn‚Äôt evenly distributed‚Äîbigger banks like Equity, KCB, and Co-op Bank have stronger reserves‚Äîsmaller banks will struggle to process large payments quickly.\n\nIf Pesalink is upgraded and more financial service providers join, smaller banks will likely have to secure additional funding or seek access to central bank liquidity to process high-value transactions to avoid a liquidity shortfall.\n\nDespite this, influential players in Kenya‚Äôs financial ecosystem still see the Pesalink upgrade as a win. It will immediately solve the country‚Äôs pressing lack of interoperability, a problem that has made it difficult to send and receive money across banks, fintechs, and mobile money operators.\n\nThe KBA is pro-Pesalink because the system is already bank-owned and operational, which banks see as a practical alternative to a completely new FPS. Yet, in all these talks about the Pesalink versus new FPS debate, there‚Äôs one notable omission in discussions: fintechs. Kenyan fintechs‚Äî [over 100 of them](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/240613-tech-disruption-in-retail-banking-fintechs-are-fueling-financial-inclusion-in-kenya-13117846#:~:text=Kenya%20Is%20A%20Hotbed%20For,all%20fintechs%20on%20the%20continent.)‚Äîhave yet to comment on the matter that affects them. This is likely due to the absence of a unified body to present their opinions‚Äîor they could be engaging regulators behind-the-scenes.\n\nHowever, the talks concern them, but fintechs may not be speaking up to prevent scrutiny from the regulator.\n\nYet, the gavel is firmly in the hand of the CBK: like the proponents, does it see Pesalink as a long-term solution for Kenya‚Äôs payments? Or, will carrying the weight of building a new FPS and suffering the fragmentation problem for another four years give it the relief that it wants?\n\n[![](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/Twitter.png)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/safaricom-pesalink-banks-fps/)[![](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/LinkedIn.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/safaricom-pesalink-banks-fps/;summary=&source=)[![](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/WhatsApp.png)](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/safaricom-pesalink-banks-fps/)\n\n##### Afincran Connect: A Fintech Mixer by Fincra üåü\n\n[![Fincra Ad Assets](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2025/01/TC-Banner.png)](https://lu.ma/5pbjc3ek?tk=UxE0Fx)\n\nFincra is hosting an exclusive fintech mixer on 12th February 2025 in Nairobi, bringing together industry leaders for networking, conversations, and connections.\n\nüìç Nairobi \\| ‚è∞ 18:00 ‚Äì 21:00 EAT\n\nLimited spots‚Äî [RSVP now](https://lu.ma/5pbjc3ek?tk=UxE0Fx).\n\n### Layoffs\n\n### Bento lays off its entire tech team over protests for delayed salaries\n\n[![](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2025/01/Ebun-Okubanjo-1024x632-1.webp)](https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/bento-layoff-tech-team/) Bento ex-CEO Ebun Okubanjo\n\nBento, a Nigerian HR tech and payroll management startup, just delivered a masterclass on what _not_ to do as a startup leader. After delaying January salaries amid a financial crunch, founder Ebun Okubanjo abruptly [laid off the entire tech team](https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/bento-layoff-tech-team/) when they protested for delayed salaries owed in January 2025. This comes hot on the heels of public scrutiny and [allegations that the company forged tax receipts](https://techcabal.com/2025/01/27/bento-africa-investigation/) and failed to remit millions in taxes and pensions.\n\nThe result of the layoff is a stalled payroll system, a company in crisis, and a team of young engineers left stranded. Okubanjo, who resigned on January 30, defended the salary delay as ‚Äústrategic‚Äù and treated the protest as resignations. He deactivated employees‚Äô work emails without pay and offered to divide withheld salaries among those willing to stay‚Äîbut no one accepted.\n\nBento‚Äôs now-dismissed tech team, composed mainly of young engineers, had been with the company for just over a year. Their departure has severely disrupted operations, particularly payroll processing, which had already faced manual intervention due to payment processor issues.\n\nDespite the chaos, Bento claims transactions were intentionally halted to facilitate a transfer of platform credentials from Okubanjo to an interim overseer. However, at least two investors have denied knowledge of the company‚Äôs official stance.\n\nWith employees raising concerns about the long-term impact on their careers, Bento‚Äôs latest crisis raises serious questions about the company‚Äôs future. The situation leaves little confidence in the company‚Äôs ability to recover.\n\n[![](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/Twitter.png)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/bento-layoff-tech-team/)[![](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/LinkedIn.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/bento-layoff-tech-team/;summary=&source=)[![](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/WhatsApp.png)](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/bento-layoff-tech-team/)\n\n### Telecoms\n\n### Nigeria launches National Broadband Alliance to boost internet\n\n[![The first cohort of the Go Time AI accelerator](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2025/02/Telecom-tariffs.webp)](https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/nigeria-internet-penetration/) Image: TechCabal\n\nNigeria is on a mission to boost its internet game with the [National Broadband Alliance for Nigeria (NBAN)](https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/nigeria-internet-penetration/), aiming for a whopping 70% broadband penetration by 2025. Spearheaded by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), this initiative targets key locations like schools, hospitals, and even religious centres‚Äîbecause everyone deserves divine Wi-Fi speed.\n\nTo make this dream a reality, NBAN is bringing together state governments, telecom giants, and infrastructure wizards. The pilot programme kicks off in eight states, while the NCC has sweetened the deal (or soured it, depending on your perspective) with a 50% tariff hike for telecom operators‚Äîon the condition that service quality improves within three months. No pressure!\n\nMeanwhile, MTN and 9mobile are teaming up for a roaming and spectrum-sharing deal, proving that even telecom rivals can be friends when it comes to better coverage. But challenges remain‚Äîlow 4G and 5G adoption, multiple taxes, and, of course, the occasional infrastructure vandal. With NBAN pushing for regulatory streamlining and private-sector investment, Nigeria‚Äôs internet future is looking bright‚Äîhopefully bright enough to finally stream movies without buffering.\n\n[![](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/Twitter.png)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/nigeria-internet-penetration/)[![](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/LinkedIn.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/nigeria-internet-penetration/;summary=&source=)[![](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/WhatsApp.png)](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://techcabal.com/2025/02/04/nigeria-internet-penetration/)\n\n##### You can now integrate Paystack with Vendy\n\n[![Subscribe to Paystack Ad Assets](https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2025/02/Vendy-Paystack.webp)](https://paystack.com/integrations?id=vendy)\n\nVendy makes it easier than ever for businesses on WhatsApp to buy, sell, and receive payments.
